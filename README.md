# Forever-Extending-Hungry-Snake

Forever Extending Hungry Snake is a Commodore 64 snake game, with a difference. It is a hi score attack challenge in which you control a snake which is forever growing. Its task is to eat the scrummy fruit. The snake can also eat bombs, which will clear the screen. However, if the snake eats itself of a skull, it is dead and the game is over. This complete project consists of a front end, with title music and in game music, jingles, etc. 

Forever Extending Hungry Snake was originally created and developed on theC64 full size computer. However, this source code has been converted to run in **64TASS** or any other cross-assembler for any of you who would like to explore the source code of this small game project or make sequels of your own just for fun. There is also a full blog about the development of Forever Extending Hungry Snake available at this link below:

## Applications Required 

Please use GOOGLE to search for the following applications required for this project: 

**Essential:**
* A suitable IDE that can run batch files. Notepad ++ is a good example
* 64TASS cross assembler
* Exomizer (any version)
* A C64 emulator such as VICE for testing the game project (Make sure your settings have been set to allow joystick or joystick keys)

**Optional:**
* Charpad V2.0 or higher
* Spritepad V2.0 or higher
* Dir Master by Style

## C64 Notes:

All graphics data and music are standard Commodore 64 format, and are not in raw binary format. However if you would like to explore the files inside PC programs. Charpad and Spritepad are a good resources for this. Music is composed in **Demo Music Creator V2.0** and **cannot** be played in Goat Tracker, Cheesecutter or SIDFactory music composers. You might need to program a tool that can handle this.

## Important ##

The project and the source was created and developed by TND games. You are welcome to explore the source and use it for your own productions, but if you use the music or graphics, please credit **Richard/TND** for those.
